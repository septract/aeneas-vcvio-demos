  Demo 3 (cost adequacy) — the hybrid reduction is *efficient relative to the adversary*.

  The audit's strongest point was that `prgAdvantage` quantifies over *all* adversaries and the
  "reduction is no heavier than `A`" remark was informal. This file makes it a theorem, in the
  only cost measure the pure `ProbComp` model offers: **query count** to the uniform-sampling
  oracle (`IsTotalQueryBound`).

  The reduction is `fun b => redStream G b n i >>= A`: it runs `A` once after sampling `i`
  fresh keys and running a deterministic chain. So its query count is `A`'s plus the cost of `i`
  key-samples. We prove exactly that: writing `qKey` for the (constant) query cost of one
  `$ᵗ Key`, the reduction makes at most `i·qKey + qA` queries when `A` makes at most `qA`. With a
  polynomial chain length the overhead `i·qKey` is polynomial, so the reduction maps poly-query
  adversaries to poly-query adversaries — efficiency preservation. We then restate ratchet
  security against the **poly-query adversary class**, with the PRG assumption made relative to
  that same class (closing the "all adversaries" gap), the per-hop bound now *derived* from
  PRG-security-against-poly-query rather than assumed for each specific reduction.

  `qKey` is taken as a parameter (the query cost of sampling one fixed-size key — manifestly a
  finite constant); computing its exact value would fight VCVio's `SampleableType` instance
  internals and is irrelevant to the cost-adequacy argument, which is *relative* to `A`.

/-- **Every finite-range computation makes finitely many queries.** An `OracleComp` is a finite
term, so it has *some* total query bound; in the `queryBind` case we take the `max` over the
finite oracle range of the continuations' bounds. This discharges the existence of a finite
per-sample query cost (`qKey`) without computing it from the `SampleableType` internals. -/

`isTotalQueryBound_bind`.) -/

/-! ## Cost-aware ratchet security: secure against the poly-query adversary class.

This closes the audit's two cost caveats. The PRG hardness assumption (`hPRG`) is now made
**relative to an efficiency class** — distinguishers making at most `(pLen·keyCost + pA)`
queries — rather than all adversaries; and the reductions are **proved** to stay inside that
class (efficiency preservation), via `reduction_queryBound` and `keyCost_spec`. The per-hop
advantage bound (`hbound` of `ratchet_secure_asymptotic`) is then *derived*, not assumed. -/

/-- **Cost-aware asymptotic security.** Let `A` be a distinguisher family making at most
`pA(sp)` queries, and `len` a polynomially-bounded chain length (`len sp ≤ pLen(sp)`). If the
block PRG `G` is `ε`-secure against distinguishers making at most `(pLen·keyCost + pA)(sp)`
queries — for a negligible `ε` — then the ChaCha-style ratchet's message-key stream is
pseudorandom (negligible advantage). Each per-step reduction calls `A` once plus `i ≤ len sp`
key-samples, so it makes `≤ i·keyCost + pA(sp) ≤ (pLen·keyCost + pA)(sp)` queries — inside the
class `hPRG` covers; that fact is proved here, not assumed. -/
